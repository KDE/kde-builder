# Getting Started Conclusion

These are the major features and concepts needed to get started with kde-builder

For additional information, you could keep reading through this
documentation. In particular, the [list of command-line
options](../chapter_05/supported-cmdline-params) and the [table of configuration file
options](../chapter_04/conf-options-table) are useful references.

The KDE Community also maintains [an online Wiki reference for how to
build the source
code](https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source),
which refers to kde-builder and includes tips and other guidelines on
how to use the tool.
