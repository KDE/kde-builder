# Preface

Normally using kdesrc-build after you have gone through
[](../chapter_02/index) is as easy as doing the following from a
terminal prompt:

    % kdesrc-build

kdesrc-build will then download the sources for KDE, try to configure
and build them, and then install them.

Read on to discover how kdesrc-build does this, and what else you can do
with this tool.
