# Documentation Overview

This guide is an overview to describe the following aspects of
kde-builder operation:

- An [overview](../getting-started/before-building) of the steps required to get started.

- Notable [features](../chapter_03/features).

- The [configuration file](../getting-started/configure-data) syntax and options.

- The [command line options](../chapter_05/cmdline).

Also documented are the steps which you should perform using other tools
(i.e. steps that are not automatically performed by kde-builder).
