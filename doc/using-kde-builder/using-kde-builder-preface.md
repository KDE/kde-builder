# Preface

Normally using kde-builder after you have gone through
[](../getting-started/index) is as easy as doing the following from a
terminal prompt:

```
kde-builder
```

kde-builder will then download the sources for KDE, try to configure
and build them, and then install them.

Read on to discover how kde-builder does this, and what else you can do
with this tool.
