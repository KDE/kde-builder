# Ignoring:

# E501 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/line-too-long/. We use lines longer than "standard".

# D100 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-module/. We do not document the modules (python files).
# D102 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-method/. We do not always document methods.
# D103 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-function/. We do not always document functions.
# D105 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-magic-method/. We do not always document magic methods.
# D107 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-init/. We do not always document __init__ methods.
# D200 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/fits-on-one-line/. We do not agree that one line docstrings should open and close on the same line, as this makes inconsistent look of them.
# D212 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multi-line-summary-first-line/. We use D213 rule instead.

# D203 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/one-blank-line-before-class/. Just to be explicit. Already disabled by following google pydocstyle convention. We use D211 rule instead.
# D406 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/new-line-after-section-name/. Just to be explicit. Already disabled by following google pydocstyle convention.
# D407 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/dashed-underline-after-section/. Just to be explicit. Already disabled by following google pydocstyle convention.
# D413 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blank-line-after-last-section/. Just to be explicit. Already disabled by following google pydocstyle convention.

extend-select = ["D204", "D404"]
# D204 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/one-blank-line-after-class/. Follow pep257 convention: add blank line after _class_ docstring.
# D404 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-starts-with-this/. Follow pep257 convention: do not start docstring with "this" word.
